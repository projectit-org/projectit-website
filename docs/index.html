<title>ProjectIt Language Workbench</title>
<h1>ProjectIt Language Workbench </h1>
<p>
This is the previous homepage of ProjectIt, a workbench for developing Domain Specific Languages (DSL) that works natively on the web.
</p>
<p>
Because the nature of ProjectIt has changed from a tool to create a projectional editor to a tool to create a full DSL,
it was decided to change the name of the project to Freon.

	This project has moved to <a href="https://www.freon4dsl.dev">Freon</a>.
